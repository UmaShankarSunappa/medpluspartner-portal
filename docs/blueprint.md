## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light desaturated blue (#94BDBD), suggestive of reliability and health.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) for a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Teal green (#63B7AF), provides contrast with the primary, but still blends in well.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font; a good complement to Poppins if the content uses both headlines and body text extensively.
- Use clear, modern icons to represent different functions and categories within the portal.
- A clean and intuitive layout with a sidebar navigation for easy access to all features.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
